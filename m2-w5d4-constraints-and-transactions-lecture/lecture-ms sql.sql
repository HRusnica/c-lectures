-- Constraints




-- INSERT DATA
-- Let's add Klingon to the languages in the database.
--  Don't have a country code handy, and not sure about whether its an offical language anywhere, or the percentage of people who speak, but I want to get it into the database before I forget.


-- That wasn't very friendly.
-- But I really want to get the record into the table, so I'll use a made up countrycode, and guess that its likely not an official language anywhere, and the percentage is near enough to zero, that its ok to specify that.


-- Referential integrity requires that foreign keys point to valid primary keys. There is no country with a code of XQR in the database
-- Since Star Trek is an American TV show, let's set the countrylanguage.countrycode to 'USA', and hope it all works out.


-- let's confirm



-- Add the exciting new language, Klinglish.



-- You can also rearrange the column names in the list, you just need to make sure the values match.



-- DELETE
-- Let's delete all the Klingon, Klingish, and Englon rows we just added, starting with Englon.


-- Then a simple select to confirm the deletion



-- The WHERE clause can have other conditions besides equals. 
 -- We can could do `language='Klingon' or language='Klinglish'`. 
 -- We might even do something daring, `'language LIKE 'Kling%'`, and remove the rows with a wildcard LIKE.  
 -- BETWEEN n AND n+1` is also a really handy technique for deleting rows within a range of values, such numeric keys.

 

-- The last deletion exercise demonstrates referential integrity.
-- Confirm the county.captial for USA is Washington.


-- Remember, country.capital is a foreign key pointing to city.id.  Attempting to delete Washington from the city table using its id will violate referential integrity, and the deletion will not be allowed.




-- UPDATE
-- Let's start by adding back Klingon.


-- And just in time, because Klingon is now an official language in the US, and is spoken by 2 percent of the population.



-- TRANSACTIONS
-- Let's wrap updating the Klingon row in a trasaction. Begin by noting the current values for isofficial and percentage.


-- Now start the transaction, change isofficial and percentage, and then commit.

-- Confirm the commited transaction took place.


-- Repeat with new values for isoficial and percentage, and this time rollback the tranaction.



-- Finally, confirm that the changes were not committed, but were rolled back.
